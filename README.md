# Movie Analysis

If you're curious what factors influence movie success in the box-office, check out my analysis below. I used a public dataset of movies from the IMDB database, and performed linear regression analysis and A/B ANOVA testing controlling for different variables (e.g. movie runtime, genre, month of release, etc.) to see what the biggest drivers were for movie success.
